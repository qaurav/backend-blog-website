### coding challenge of ibriz.ai 
As i am wondering an internship for nodejs and as per my understanding I have completed following tasks:
# 1. Used express as framework for nodejss
# 2. Mongodb as database 
# 3. Created Rest api for users & posts
# 4. Brycpt package for password hashing
# 5. Used mongoose pre hook to validate password 

Due to my lack of understanding of testing with Jest, i am not able to do testing.

Frontend portion of the challenge is also not done as i am unfamilair with React
